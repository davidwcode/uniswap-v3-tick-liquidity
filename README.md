# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


### Steps to get started
Run `npm install` to install all dependencies

Run ```npm start``` to start the web application

After the ```localhost:3000``` page loads, add a path that directs to the pool you want liquidity values for
- ex: localhost:3000/0x4585fe77225b41b697c938b018e2ac67ac5a20c0

Once the data is loaded in, a link will appear with the desired information.
